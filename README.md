### Financial Data Case Study in Applied Machine Learning

As part of our Applied Machine Learning class, we conducted a financial data case study focusing on predicting the value of an option using machine learning techniques. In the finance industry, the Black-Scholes model is a well-known mathematical model used to predict option prices. We aimed to explore whether a data-driven approach could effectively solve this complex problem.

To achieve this, we incorporated all the variables used in the Black-Scholes formula, such as the underlying asset price, interest rate, time to maturity, and strike price of the option. These variables served as our features. By running a series of experiments, we sought to determine if machine learning techniques could enhance or even surpass the predictive power of traditional models like Black-Scholes.

Our project not only highlights the potential of machine learning in financial applications but also provides a comprehensive comparison between data-driven and mathematically-driven approaches to option pricing. The results offer valuable insights into one of the most challenging problems in finance.
